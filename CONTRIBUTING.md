# Contribute

Each package has its own specifications for contribution. Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the package you want to contribute to.

- [eslint-plugin](packages/eslint-plugin/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Conventional commits

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automate the release process.
Later on, we will add a `CHANGELOG.md` file to each package, which will be automatically updated on each release.
