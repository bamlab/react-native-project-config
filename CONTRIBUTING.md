## Conventional commits

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automate the release process. Please follow the commit message format described in the link above. Lerna will automatically generate the changelog for each package based on the commit messages since the last version. (see [README.md](README.md#publishing-a-new-version-of-a-package))
